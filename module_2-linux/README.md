## 2 - Operating Systems & Linux Basics

### Virtualization & Virtual Machines

You need a hypervisor to run multiple virtual machines using a physical Host OS
Most popular hypervisor is VirtualBox (Used this in the past but sinds I switched to M1 I needed to use UTM because
VirtualBox does not support M1 )
VMs are isolated Type 2 vs Type 1 Hypervisor: Type 1 installed directly on hardware for servers, Type 2 uses host OS on
personal computer

- Benefits Type 2: learn & experiment, don’t endanger main OS, test app on different OS
- Benefits Type 1: efficient usage of hardware resources, abstraction of OS from hardware via VMI (Virtual Machine
  Image) with backups/snaphots

### Linux File System

Everything in Linux is a file(In MAC / Windows it is not the case)
A root user has its own home directory. This directory can be different in different oses (In MAC it is /Users/username)

#### Linux folder structure

* /home/{Username} dir of non-root users (If the user is created with a home directory)
* /bin executables for essential system cmd
* /sbin system binaries, need super user privileges to execute
* /lib shared lib that execs from /bin or /sbin use
* /usr was used for user home dir (histroic reasons due to storage limitations)
* /usr/local programs that YOU install on computer (3rd party apps) available for all users
* /opt 3rd party programs you install that DONT split its components
* /boot files required for booting
* /etc system config
* /dev device files (webcam, mouse, keyboard etc)
* /var stores logs
* /var/cache
* /tmp temporary resources required for processes
* /media removable media
* /mnt temporary mount points

Hidden files (starts with a dot)

<summary>Video: Linux Accounts & Groups (Users & Permissions Part 1)</summary>
 <br />

**Locations of Access Control Files:**
- /etc/passwd
- /etc/shadow
- /etc/group
<!-- -->
- `sudo adduser [username]` = Create a new user
- `sudo passwd [username]` = Change password of a user
- `su - [username]` = Login as username ('su' = short for substitute or switch user)
- `su -` = Login as root
<!-- -->

<details>
<summary>Video: File Ownership & Permissions (Users & Permissions Part 2)</summary>
 <br />

- `ls -l` = Print files in a long listing format, you can see ownership and permissions of the file

**Ownership:**
- `sudo chown [username]:[groupname] [filename]` = Change ownership
- `sudo chown tom:admin test.txt` = Change ownership of 'test.txt' file to 'tom' and group 'admin'
- `sudo chown admin test.txt` = Change ownership of 'test.txt' 'admin' user
- `sudo chgrp devops test.txt` = Make 'devops' group owner of test.txt file

**Possible File Permissions (Symbolic):**
- r = Read
- w = Write
- x = Execute
- '-' = No permission

**Change File Permissions for different owners**

File Permissions can be changed for:
- u = Owner
- g = Group
- o = Other (all other users)

Minus (-) removes the permission
- `sudo chmod -x api` = Takes 'execute' permission away for 'api' folder from all owners
- `sudo chmod g-w config.yaml` = Takes 'write' permission away for 'config.yaml' file from the group 

Plus (+) adds permission
- `sudo chmod g+x config.yaml` = Add 'execute' permission for 'config.yaml' file to the group 
- `sudo chmod u+x script.sh` = Add 'execute' permission for 'script.sh' file to the user 
- `sudo chmod o+x script.sh` = Add 'execute' permission for 'script.sh' file to other 

Change multiple permissions for an owner
- `sudo chmod g=rwx config.yaml` = Assign 'read write execute' permissions to the group
- `sudo chmod g=r-- config.yaml` = Assign only 'read' permission to the group

Changing permissions with numeric values

_Set permissions for all owners with 3 digits, 1 digit for each owner_ [Absolute vs Symbolic Mode](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7229/6j6q8svd8/)

- 0 = No permission
- 1 = Execute
- 2 = Write
- 3 = Execute + Write
- 4 = Read
- 5 = Read + Execute
- 6 = Read + Write
- 7 = Read + Write + Execute
<!-- -->
- `sudo chmod 777 script.sh` = rwx (Read, Write and Execute) permission for everyone for file 'script.sh'
- `sudo chmod 740 script.sh` = Give user all permissions (7), give group only read permission (4), give other no permission (0)

<summary>Video: Basic Linux Commands - Pipes & Redirects (CLI - Part 3)</summary>
<br />

**Pipe & Less:**

Pipe Command:
- `|` = Pipe command = Pipes the output of the previous command as an input to the next command

Less Command:
- `less [filename]` = Displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time. And allows to navigate forward and backward through the file

Different piping examples/use cases:
- `cat /var/log/syslog | less` = Pipes the output of 'syslog' file to less program.
- `ls /usr/bin | less` = Pipes the output of ls command to less program.
- `history | less` = Pipes the output of history command to less program.

**Pipe & Grep:**

Grep Command:
- `grep [pattern]` = Searches for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain that pattern

More piping examples/use cases:
- `history | grep sudo` = Look for any commands of history commands, which have 'sudo' word in it
- `history | grep "sudo chmod"` = Look for any commands of history commands, which have 'sudo chmod' phrase in it
- `history | grep sudo | less` = History output will pass output to grep and filter for 'sudo' and this output will again be piped or passed to less program
- `ls /usr/bin/ | grep java` = Filter ls output for java
- `cat Documents/java-app/config.yaml | grep ports` = See all 'ports' occurences in config.yaml file

**Redirects in Linux:**
- `>` = Redirect Operator = Takes the output from the previous command and sends it to a file that you give

Different redirects examples/use cases:
- `history | grep sudo > sudo-commands.txt` = Redirect output into a 'sudo-commands.txt' file
- `cat sudo-commands.txt > sudo-rm-commands.txt` = Redirect output of 'sudo-commands.txt' file into 'sudo-rm-commands.txt' file
- `history | grep rm > sudo-rm-commands.txt` = Redirect output of filtered history commands into existing 'sudo-rm-commands.txt' file. Note: Contents of file will be _overwritten_
- `history | grep rm >> sudo-rm-commands.txt` = Redirect output of filtered history commands into existing 'sudo-rm-commands.txt' file. Note: Contents of file will be _appended_

<summary>Video: Environment Variables</summary>
<br />

_Variables store information. Environment variables are available for the whole environment._
_An environment variable consists of _name=value_ pair._

**Existing Environment Variables:**
- `SHELL=/bin/bash`= default shell program, in this case bash
- `HOME=/home/nana`= current user's home directory
- `USER=nana` = currently logged in user
<!-- -->
- `printenv` = List all environment variables
- `printenv | less` = List all environment variables with less program
- `printenv [environment variable]` = Display value of given environment variable, e.g. `printenv USER`
- `printenv | grep USER` = Filter environment variables, which have 'USER' in the name
<!-- -->
- `echo $USER` = Print value of USER environment variable

**Create own Environment Variables:**
- `export DB_USERNAME=dbuser` = Set environment variable 'DB_USERNAME' with value 'dbuser'
- `export DB_PASSWORD=secretpwdvalue` = Set environment variable 'DB_PASSWORD' with value 'secretpwdvalue'
- `export DB_NAME=mydb` = Set environment variable 'DB_NAME' with value 'mydb'
- `printenv | grep DB` = Filter environment variables for 'DB' characters
- `export DB_NAME=newdbname` = Set environment variable 'DB_NAME' to new value 'newdbname'

**Delete Environment Variables:**
- `unset DB_NAME` = Delete variable with name 'DB_NAME'

**Persisting Environment Variables:**

Persisting Environment Variables with shell specific configuration file:
_Environment variables set in terminal are only available in the current terminal session._

Add environment variables to the '~/.bashrc' file or your specific shell 'rc' file. Variables set in this file are loaded whenever a bash login shell is entered.
- `export DB_USERNAME=dbuser`
- `export DB_PASSWORD=secretvl`
- `export DB_NAME=mydb`
In terminal again:
- `source ~/.bashcrc` = Load the new env vars into the current shell session

Persisting Environment Variables system wide:
- ~./bashrc = user specific
- /etc/environment = system wide, meaning all users will have access to the variables

**PATH Environment Variable:**
- `PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` = List of directories to executible files, separated by ':'. Tells the shell which directories to ssearch for the executable in response to our executed command
- `PATH=$PATH:/home/nana` = Appending /home/nana folder to the existing $PATH value

<summary>Video: Networking</summary>
<br />

Useful Networking Commands:
- `ip`= one of the basic commands. For setting up new systems and assigning IPs to troubleshooting existing systems. Can show address information, manipulate routing, plus display network various devices, interfaces, and tunnels.
- `ifconfig`= for configuring and troubleshooting networks. It has since been replaced by the `ip` command
- `netstat`= tool for printing network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
- `ps aux` =
  - ps = displays information about a selection of the active processes
  - a = show processes for all users
  - u = display the process's user/owner
  - x = also show processes not attached to a terminal
- `nslookup` = Find DNS related query
- `ping` = To check connectivity between two nodes

<summary>Video: SSH - Secure Shell</summary>
<br />

Connecting via SSH: `ssh username@SSHserver`
- `ssh root@64.225.108.160`= Connect with root user to 64.225.108.160 server address
- `ssh-keygen -t rsa`= Create SSH Key Pair with 'rsa' algorithm. SSH Key Pair is stored to the default location `~/.ssh`
- `ls .ssh/`= Display contents of .ssh folder, which has:
  - `id_rsa` = Private Key
  - `id_rsa.pub` = Public Key
- `ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa root@64.225.108.160` = Connect with root user to 64.225.108.160 server address with specified private key file location (.ssh/id_rsa = default, but you can specify a different one like this)

Two Files used by SSH:
- `~/.ssh/known_hosts` = lets the client authenticate the server to check that it isn't connecting to an impersonator
- `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` = lets the server authenticate the user
